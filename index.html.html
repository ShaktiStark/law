  <p>Family Law cases</p>
  <p>Family law is the area of law that addresses family relationships. It includes creating family relationships and breaking them through divorce and termination of parental rights. This law addresses adoption, contested custody of children, etc. There are five broad sets of family laws in India, namely Hindu law, which governs all Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, and Sikhs, Muslim law for the Muslims; Christian law for the Christian; Parsi law for the Parsis and secular law, i.e. the Special Marriage Act. The religion-based laws are derived from religious texts. These laws have also been amended from time-to-time by Parliamentary legislation.
